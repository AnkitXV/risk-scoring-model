A simple web application that predicts the financial risk category of a bank customer using a machine learning model.

**Objective**

This project is a demonstration of how machine learning can be used to automate customer risk classification for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations in banking. The model classifies customers into Low, Medium, or High-risk categories.

 Features

 An interactive web interface built with Streamlit.
 Real-time risk prediction based on user input.
 A classification model trained on a synthetically generated dataset.
